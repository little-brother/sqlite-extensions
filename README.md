The repository contains SQLite extensions compiled for Windows. Unlike [sqlean](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean) and [similar projects](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean#sister-projects), purpose of the repository is to provide an easy way for [sqlite-gui](https://github.com/little-brother/sqlite-gui)-users to obtain extensions and, what is important, help.



If you would like to see an another extension here, feel free to contact me at lb.im@ya.ru.
